# Logs Service

This service aims to provide an endpoint for your services to send logs to, and to give you the ability to search them.


If you wish to develop against the container, deploy as follows:

```
REGISTRY="docker-registry.your-org.org:5000"
PROJECT_NAME="logger-frontend-dev"
CONTAINER_IMAGE="`echo $REGISTRY`/`echo $PROJECT_NAME`"
PORT=80

docker kill $PROJECT_NAME
docker rm $PROJECT_NAME

docker run -d \
  -p $PORT:80 \
  -v `pwd`/code:/var/www/logger_frontend \
  --name=$PROJECT_NAME \
  $CONTAINER_IMAGE
```
